Here are some ideas to get you started:
👋 Hello there! I'm Lysa, a passionate computer science student on a journey to explore the fascinating world of software development and technology.

🎓 I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's/Master's degree in Computer Science, and I'm constantly learning and experimenting with various programming languages and technologies.

💻 My interests lie in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and open-source contributions. I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems and have a positive impact on people's lives.

🚀 I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills, and I believe in the power of collaboration and community-driven development. You'll find some of my projects and contributions here on GitHub.

📚 When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs or books, exploring new programming languages, or geeking out about the latest advancements in the tech world.
